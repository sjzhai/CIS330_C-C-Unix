Crashed

I thought I saw a box brought to life
It was warm, it booted up with Windows 95
It showed me what it was to die
Well you wouldn't use that box they installed
You don't seem to know, seem to care, 'bout 95 at all
'Cos Windows comes before a fall
There's nothing where I used to be
Tech support are fixing me
That's what's going on
Nothing's fine, I'm crashed

I'm all out of use, taken from my table
I'm cold and I am shamed, lying naked and abashed
My BIOS never changed into something stable
I'm wide awake and I can see my bright blue screen is crashed
You're a little late, I'm already crashed

So I guess the teenage loudmouth's right
Should have taken Windows out, I know I wouldn't fight
It's crawled beneath my case and now
I don't start, I have no luck
I don't network all that much
There's just so many ports
That I can't track, I'm crashed

I'm all out of use, taken from my table
I'm cold and I am shamed, got some trouble with my cache
My BIOS never changed into something stable
I'm wide awake and I can see my bright blue screen is crashed
You're a little late, I'm already crashed ...crashed

Oooh, ooh oooh, oooh

There's nothing where I used to be
'Cos they're upgrading to NT
That's what's going on
Nothing's right, I'm crashed

I'm all out of use, taken from my corner
I'm cold and I am shamed, my hard disc is getting mashed
I get this lame OS, and I'm the only mourner
I'm wide awake and I can see my bright blue screen is crashed
The future's open-source, this is how I feel
I hate our engineers, giving Microsoft their cash
You're a little late, I'm already crashed
...crashed
